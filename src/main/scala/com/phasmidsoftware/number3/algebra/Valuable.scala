  * A trait representing an object that is in some sense numerical and has a value (or possibly more than one value).

  * The properties exposed by this trait are: `isExact`, `approximation`, `maybeDouble`.
  *
  * NOTE: this trait has the same name as the `Valuable` typeclass in the `com.phasmidsoftware.number` package,
  * but it is not the same thing.
